# traffic-risk-app
A web-based application that analyses traffic accident data to assess and predict risk factors for users.
Providing users with assessment for insurance premiums. Educational purposes of showing either a higher or lower car insurance premium based on the area in which they live.
o	Key features: location-based image, traffic heatmap, weather stats, and risk assessment.


Project Brief: Traffic Accident Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool 

Project Overview 

The objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that analyses traffic accident data to assess and predict risk factors for users. By leveraging large, freely available datasets, the application will provide insights and predictions regarding the likelihood of traffic accidents based on various factors such as location, weather, and time of day. The project will be completed over 7 working days and will involve a cross-functional team including a Business Analyst (BA), Product Owner (PO), Tester, DevOps Engineer, Data Engineer, two Java Developers (one frontend-focused on React), and a Senior Stakeholder. 

Project Objectives 
Risk Assessment: Evaluate and display risk factors for traffic accidents based on user inputs. 
Prediction Modelling: Develop and implement machine learning models to predict the probability of traffic accidents. 
Data Integration: Utilize large, freely available datasets for accurate and comprehensive risk assessment and prediction. 
User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive and responsive web application for users to input data and view risk assessments and predictions. 
Performance and Security: Ensure the application performs efficiently and securely handles user data. 
Client Presentation: Deliver a presentation to the client explaining the product, what was learned, challenges faced, and teamwork dynamics. 

Key Outputs 
Functional Web Application: A fully functional web application developed using React for the frontend and Java for the backend. 
Risk Assessment Reports: Detailed reports showing risk levels based on user input. 
Prediction Dashboard: An interactive dashboard displaying risk predictions. 
API Integration: Integration with open-source APIs providing traffic, weather, and location data. 
Testing Documentation: Comprehensive testing documentation including test cases, test plans, and test results. 
Deployment Pipeline: An automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying the application. 
Project Documentation: Complete documentation of the project including user guides, technical documentation, and API references. 
Client Presentation: A presentation detailing the product, learnings, challenges, solutions, and teamwork. 

Open-Source Datasets and APIs 
Traffic Accident Data: US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - NHTSA Crash Data 
Weather Data: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) - NOAA Weather Data 
Geospatial Data: United States Geological Survey (USGS) - USGS Geospatial Data 

Team Roles and Responsibilities 
Business Analyst (BA): Gather and document requirements, ensure alignment with business objectives, and facilitate communication between stakeholders and the development team. 
Product Owner (PO): Prioritize the backlog, ensure the project meets business goals, and provide direction and feedback to the development team. 
Tester: Develop and execute test cases, ensure the quality of the application, and identify and report bugs. 
DevOps Engineer: Set up and maintain the CI/CD pipeline, ensure smooth deployment processes, and manage infrastructure. 
Data Engineer: Collect, preprocess, and manage large datasets; ensure data quality and accessibility for analysis and modelling. 
Java Developer (Backend): Develop and maintain backend services, integrate with the API, and ensure data processing and security. 
Java Developer (Frontend - React): Develop and maintain the frontend of the application, ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface. 
Senior Stakeholder: Provide strategic oversight, ensure alignment with business goals, and make high-level decisions.
